# Pomodoro-timer

Some say the best method to increase your productivity is to use the Pomodoro timer. 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. I have been trying to practice this method, that's when I decided to make a python program which acts as a Pomodoro timer on my Windows PC. 
// "Pomowithtkinter" uses the tkinter library 
// "Pomowithplyer" uses the plyer library with does not come preinstalled and has to be installed by pip command
